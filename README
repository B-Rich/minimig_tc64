TurboChameleon64 Port of Minimig
--------------------------------

This repository hosts the MiniMig[1] menu controller code ported to a Motorola
68000 SoftCore by Tobias Gubener (TobiFlexx) for the TurboChameleon64[2] FPGA
cartridge by Individual Computers.

Build
-----

You will need the DICE[3] Amiga C compiler either as a native or a cross
compiler to build the menu code.

See the INSTALL file for more details.


Contribute
----------

I'll keep updates to the menu code in this repository. If you have fixes,
extension, or other contributions then drop me an email or a push request to
include them here.


Have Fun,
