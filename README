TurboChameleon64 Port of Minimig
--------------------------------

This repository hosts the MiniMig[1] menu controller code ported to a Motorola
68000 SoftCore by Tobias Gubener (TobiFlexx) for the TurboChameleon64[2] FPGA
cartridge by Individual Computers.

Build
-----

You will need the DICE[3] Amiga C compiler either as a native or a cross
compiler to build the menu code.

See the INSTALL file for more details.

Run
---

You need a Chameleon cartridge to run the MiniMig menu code. Install the
latest Core from [4] and set up a SD card with the provided files and a
Kickstart ROM image. Finally replace the "OSD_CA01.sys" menu code with your
newly build one and run the core.

Contribute
----------

I'll keep updates to the menu code in this repository. If you have fixes,
extension, or other contributions then drop me an email or a GitHub push
request to include them here.


Have Fun,
