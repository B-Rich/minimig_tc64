INSTALL

Preface:

The controller m68k CPU code is written in C and compiled using DICE [1].
You do not need any target specific libraries or headers (e.g. Amiga).


A) On a UNIX System (Linux, Mac OS X, ...)
------------------------------------------

1. First you need to compile and setup DICE from source as a cross-compiler on
your host machine. I have written a How To on my Blog [2]. This describes the
Mac setup but it will work on Linux and other *nixes, too.

I use the install location /opt/dice defined in DHOME in the Makefile.
If you user another location than you need to adjust this value.

2. Call the Makefile supplied in the "unix" directory:

> cd unix
> make

This will create the "OSD_CA01.sys" menu binary ready to be installed on a SD card. 


B) On an Amiga System
---------------------

0. Make this code tree including "amiga" and "src" folders available on your
Amiga. 
   a.) You can create a Disk (image) and copy both directories there.
   b.) Copy them to a SD Card
   c.) Use a virtual drive with host directory in an emulator like UAE

1. This distribution already ships a mini distribution of DICE 3.16 [1]. So
everything is setup to compile the code.

2. Enter the "amiga" directory and call "dmake" there from the the
"dice_mini/bin" directory:

 cd amiga
 dice_mini/bin/dmake

This will create the "OSD_CA01.sys" menu binary ready to be installed on a SD card.
