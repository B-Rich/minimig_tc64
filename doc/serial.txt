serial.txt - Serial Connection on the MiniMig TC64 Core
-------------------------------------------------------

The core currently supports two serial ports all wired to pins on the IEC 
connector of the Chameleon.

The protocol for both is RS 232 but the levels are _NOT_ (!!!)

Both tolerate signal levels from 0V up to 5V and therefore need a serial device 
connected with TTL 5V levels.

!!! NEVER USE AN ORDINARY RS232 SERIAL DEVICE WITH -12V TO 12V LEVELS DIRECTLY 
AT THE IEC CONNECTOR - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!

E.g. I use a FT232 USB-to-serial break out board that provides TxD and RxD with 
5V levels.


1.) Amiga Paula Serial

The RS232 port available in a real Amiga (provided by custom chip Paula) is wired on this
Minimig core, too. The RxD and TxD are available as IEC_CLK (Rxd) and IEC_ATN (Txd).

IEC Connector:

Pin 2	- GND
Pin 3   - IEC_ATN  = Amiga Serial TxD
Pin 4   - IEC_CLK  = Amiga Serial RxD

The serial paramters of this port depend on the values you set up on your Amiga.


2.) Debug Serial for OSD Menu Code Diagnosis

This port is a transmit (TxD) only port and provides debugging information from
the 68K SoftCore running the Menu Code. Its mainly useful for menu code or core
developers.

IEC Connector:

Pin 2   - GND
Pin 5   - IEC_DATA = Debug Serial TxD

The serial parameters are 115200 Baud, 8 N 1, no flow control
